# Input Validation and Date Utilities

A small C++ utility project that contains reusable components for:

- Validating user input**
- Working with dates (incrementing, validation, formatting, etc.)

This project represents my first steps in building clean logic, reusable classes, and combining code pieces together — just like assembling LEGO blocks.  
I aim to build a solid foundation in C++ programming and learn how to structure real projects.



 Features:
 Input Validation:
- Validate integers, doubles, ranges, and strings.
- Clean and reusable validation functions.
- Encapsulated inside the `clsInputValidate` class.

 Date Utilities:
- Date formatting and parsing.
- Adding days to a date.
- Comparing two dates.
- Struct-based date representation.
- All logic inside `clsDate` utilities.
